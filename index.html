            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown"> Software Engineering Student & Web Developer</p>
            <p>I am a Sophomore at Iowa State studying Software engineering. I'm also involved
                in the marching band here, as well as being active in a musical ensemble 
                at the university. My coursework has taken me through object oriented programming and 
                data structures, as well as Verilog. Currently, I am learning HTML/CSS, taking
                a course in discrete mathematics, and learning how to program microcontrollers in a embedded systems class!

                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                        only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                        creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                        Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                        text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                        two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                        related to the project itself.
